# -arm-uClibc-toolchain_buildroot
HowTo: Rebuild arm-toolchain (gcc 4.5.3 + uClibc 0.9.3X.X) for FreshTomato with Buildroot (2012.02) 


>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>< coming soon!
actually on preparation, first with uClibc 0.9.32.1 (without NPTL); toolchain already compiled with gcc-4.9.4 on Artix (Arch Linux) and bildroot 2012.02; but need for building test (with Asus RT_AC-56U))
gcc-4.9.4 is also available on Debian 7. (-> VM)

GOAL: To make it possible to build customized toolhains with special features of 0.9.32.1 - 0.9.33.2 (w/o TLS, w/o NPTL,...)
